      Unattended Installation
Windows XP, Vista, 2003 & 2008 Server


Unattended Installations:
=========================

If you do not want to be presented with the "Found New Hardware Wizard" 
prompting you to specify the location of the AnywhereUSB drivers during the 
installation of an AnywhereUSB, then you can perform an Unattended Installation.
The following steps are for setting up an Unattended Installation.

1. Extract the driver package to a directory on your hard disk. For the 
   purposes of these instructions we will assume that the drivers were extracted 
   to the following directory "C:\AnywhereUSB Drivers", but you may alter this in
   your own installations.

2. Using REGEDIT.EXE or any other registry editor, append the directory 
   that you have extracted this installation package to, to the DevicePath 
   registry variable. The DevicePath registry variable is a REG_EXPAND_SZ 
   variable that specifies the default directories that Windows will search
   during hardware installations. The directory that you are appending 
   needs to be the same directory where this installation package was 
   extracted to. Use a semicolon ';' as a separator in between directories, 
   no spaces are required in between semi-colons and the added directories. 
   For example if you extracted the install package to "C:\AnywhereUSB Drivers"
   then the DevicePath registry variable would look like this:

   Name:          Type:            Data:
   DevicePath     REG_EXPAND_SZ    %SystemRoot%\inf;"C:\AnywhereUSB Drivers"

   The DevicePath variable is found in the following registry key: 
   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\

3. Launch "C:\AnywhereUSB Drivers\Setup.exe -s" to install the Network Attached 
   USB Enumerator driver.

   NOTE: Make sure to add the "-s" silent install parameter to the Setup.exe 
   program in order to avoid being prompted for user input. Installations on 
   64bit versions of Windows should use Setup64.exe instead of Setup.exe.

4. Connect to the AnywhereUSB Concentrator using the configuration utility, 
   found in Start->Programs->AnywhereUSB->AnywhereUSB Configuration Utility 
   and the rest of the drivers will install without prompting for user input.

   An alternative method to connecting to the AnywhereUSB Concentrator is to 
   manually add the IP Address of the Concentrator to be connected to the registry.
   To do this add the IP Address to the following key:

   Name:             Type:            Data:
   IpAddressList     REG_MULTI_SZ     xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx <- IP Address of Concentrator

   The IpAddressList variable is found in the following registry key: 
   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Awusbsys
